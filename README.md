# Inochi2D Gallium
Set of precompiled libraries for supporting Inochi2D software on Intel Integrated Graphics.  
As of current it's more or less impossible to properly use OpenGL on Intel Integrated,  
as such we provide precompiled builds from [mesa-dist-win](https://github.com/pal1000/mesa-dist-win) by pal1000 here.

These precompiled binaries will be shipped in select "compatibility" versions of Inochi Creator and Inochi Session.
